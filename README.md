`chmod +x destroy-linux.sh`

Update: Working on an EXE File for the Windows ppl.

NOTE: I removed the EFI shredding due to it being pointless and extremely buggy on Windows 8 and below. Please understand.

NOTE 2: I won't really be updating this until something changes in Windows, the Linux Kernel or an error in the code so don't expect frequent updates.

NOTE 3: If you want to use git on Windows you might have to install it here > (https://git-scm.com)
