# PC-Shredder-3000
A script that instantly destroys any PC so you don't have to!

Available in Windows and Linux flavors (no, I do not plan to add mac support)

Minimum System Requirements:

Windows XP (Untested) or later / Any Linux Version it doesn't matter

(Note for Windows 10 and above: Disable Windows Defender because it causes lots of issues with this script. I am currently wotking on a fix.)

Tested on the following OSes:

Ubuntu 20.04

Arch Linux

EndeavourOS

Windows 7 to 10

Installation:

Universal: Run this command:

`git clone https://github.com/TheNewEraBrad/PC-Shredder-3000`

For Windows users: Download the files as zip and extract, run `destroy-win.bat`

For Linux users: Use git or the `Download as zip` and run the following commands:

`chmod +x destroy-linux.sh`

`./destroy-linux.sh`

Enjoy a bricked PC!

Update: Working on an EXE File for the Windows people.

NOTE: I removed the EFI shredding due to it being pointless and extremely buggy on Windows 8 and below. Please understand.

NOTE 2: I won't really be updating this until something changes in Windows, the Linux Kernel or an error in the code so don't expect frequent updates.

NOTE 3: If you want to use git on Windows you might have to install it here > (https://git-scm.com)
